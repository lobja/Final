                      ‘The Matrix: Resurrections’ Guide: 23 Details to Know About the Return of the Iconic Action Franchise 
                    </div>
                    <div className='TxtPlot'>
                    Eighteen years after “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The Matrix Revolutions” ended “The Matrix” trilogy in polarizing fashion among film critics and fans, 
                    Lana Wachowski is bringing the iconic action franchise back for a fourth go-around on the big screen with the upcoming fourth installment of “The Matrix.” As 
                    revealed at the 2021 CinemaCon, the film is titled “The Matrix: Resurrections,” an appropriate one considering the film will have to explain how main characters 
                    Neo and Trinity are now alive, but there’s enough information out there about the secretive fourth “Matrix” installment to get fans excited for its December 22, 
                    2021 release.

                     Buzz for “The Matrix 4” has surged for quite some time, although it wasn’t until August 19, 2020 that Warner Bros. confirmed the project was official. Before that date, 
                     “John Wick” director Chad Stahelski let it slip that Lana Wachowski was returning to the world of “The Matrix” for a new movie. Stahelski was Keanu Reeves’ stunt double on “The Matrix” films.

                    “I’m super happy that the Wachowskis are not just doing a ‘Matrix,’ but they’re expanding what we all loved,” Stahelski told Yahoo at the time. “And if it’s anywhere near the level of what 
                     they’ve already done, it wouldn’t take more than a call to go, ‘Hey, we want you to be a stunt guy’ and I would probably go and get hit by a car.”

                    With “The Matrix: Resurrections” fast approaching, IndieWire breaks down every major detail we know about the sequel so far. New updates will be added to the below as they are announced.

                    <div className='TxtTitle'> Official Poster</div><br/>
                    Feast your eyes on the official poster for “The Matrix Ressurections.” Front and center are Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss as Neo and Trinity. 
                    The fan favorite characters are flanked by newcomers Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (playing Morpheus, although maybe not the Morpheus fans all know and love) 
                    and Jessica Henwick. Just as the official trailer for the movie shook up the visual language of the franchise (a lot of brighter colors, for instance), the poster presents a 
                    more 3D, digital cyberspace than the classic green ticker-tape look of “The Matrix.”

                    <div className='TxtTitle'>There’s a New Morpheus in Town</div><br/>
                    Shortly after Warner Bros. dropped the official trailer for “The Matrix Resurrections,” Yahya Abdul-Mateen II confirmed the long-standing rumor 
                    that he is playing Morpheus in the new movie. But that doesn’t necessarily mean he is playing the same Morpheus that Laurence Fishburne brought to 
                    iconic life in the original trilogy. In a November 2021 interview with British GQ, Abdul-Mateen II hinted there’s a difference between playing a 
                    character called Morpheus and playing a character who actually is Fishburne’s iteration of Morpheus.

                    As reported by British GQ: “‘The character’s called Morpheus,’ [Abdul-Mateen II] corrects me, fast. There is some consternation online about why 
                    Laurence Fishburne, the original Morpheus, is not playing the character called Morpheus, given Keanu Reeves is back as Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss as 
                    Trinity. Has he spoken to Fishburne? ‘By the time this interview comes out, I would have. I want to.’ It should be pointed out that Fishburne has 
                    not only been very gracious in the build-up to this fourth film, but also that, if you go by strict ‘Matrix’ folklore, namely a video game called 
                    ‘The Matrix Online,’ Morpheus is actually dead. ‘It will make sense when it comes out,’ says Abdul-Mateen, who is playing Morpheus but is not Morpheus.”

                    <div className='TxtTitle'>First Look Images Revealed</div><br/>
                    On September 7, Warner Bros. debuted the highly anticipated first images from “The Matrix Resurrections” via a nifty website called “Choose Your 
                    Reality.” You can click on either a red pill or a blue pill, just like in the original movie, and depending on your choice you’ll get images of either
                     life inside the Matrix — culminating in what appears to be a blue pill-popping Thomas Anderson (the Clark Kent Matrix reality of Keanu Reeves’ Neo) 
                     standing on a ledge with a very long drop — or action images of the human resistance fighting back.

                    There’s Jessica Henwick firing a gun, Reeves looking very John Wick, a guy with a Matrix jack in the back of his head, and new cast member Yahya
                     Abdul-Mateen II first looking at himself in a mirror and then materializing Dr. Manhattan-style in a swirl of nanoprobes.

                    The coolest thing about the site? That the images you see change based on the time you click.
